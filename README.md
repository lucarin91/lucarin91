### Hi there 👋

I'm a last year Ph.D. student 🎓 in Parallel Programming Model.
I'm ✨looking for a job✨ in Parallel Programming and Cloud infrastructure in C++/Rust and more.

🔭 I’m currently working on my thesis project, [CAF-PP](https://github.com/ParaGroup/caf-pp) a *Parallel Pattern Library* for the [C++ Actor Framework](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework) *Actor Model*. Bedide, my previus research projects was aboud Cloud Orchestration ([TosKer](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/TosKer), [TosKeriser](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/TosKeriser))

🌱 In my free time, I’m learning Unreal Engine (maybe someday I will program a videogame 😄), Rust, and Typescript.
Some of my last personal projects are:
- [ff_buffer-rs](https://github.com/lucarin91/ff_buffer) a wrapper of the FastFlow lock-free queue for Rust 
- [balanced-chunks-rs](https://github.com/lucarin91/balanced-chunks-rs) an injected method for splitting a vector in even sized chunks
- [dmenu-react](https://github.com/lucarin91/dmenu-react) a dmenu-like navbar component written in React
- [halftone-glyph](https://github.com/lucarin91/halftone-glyph) a tool to generate images in which pixels are substituted by characters
- [golfscript-rs](https://github.com/lucarin91/golfscript-rs) a fork and extended version of a simple [Golfscript](http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript) interpreter
